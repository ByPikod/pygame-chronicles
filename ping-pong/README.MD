    Ping Pong
</h1>
<p align="center">
    Classic ping pong game that you can play with a friend.<br>
    While first player is controlled with "w" and "s" buttons the second 
    player is controlled with "up arrow" and "down arrow".<br>
    Speed of the ball will increase every time it bounced from a player. <br>
    While there is no speed limit for the ball it will reset every round. <br>

    Note: This is the first game I've ever made in without a high level API such as Unity and UE.
